So what are your reactions when the stock market rates rises or fall. I am sure that situation must be a compound reactions of excitement or hapiness. Now when I say the same situation is what you will experience with your favourite drinks, the moment when your favourite drink prices will fall, ah! Thats kind of smile is what I was expecting. Yes! Guys, an Ultimate place for all those, who love to relax on Friday nights, watch live music or cricket match, then it's the right place for you.
This place will lit up your spirit with it's Aura. It is large and wide in space with both ground and first floor seating area. The furnitures are adequately apart from each other there by reducing direct interference with other tables. So it's kind of "my space".
The lighting of the area was enough for you to take selfies.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
Food was extremely delicious. The starters served were all delectable and satisfied my tastebuds. I didn't had the space to eat the main course, however I didn't want to miss any chance so without a second thought I gorged upon the main course dishes.
My recommendation for you is to try Dahi Ke Sholey, Chicken Lollipop, Fish Poppers, Paneer Tikka. All of them were exceptionally mouth watering. And yes do try their mocktails. I tried Virgin Mojito and Raspberry and Orange Twist, both were perfectly blended.

The staffs were all courteous and were very helpful. As I was attending a ladies meet, so they made sure that we all get our cabs by talking to the drivers and guided them to reach on the location to pick all of us.

Vapour bar exchange is a place which will entice you to try it once with its amazing interiors and exteriors . they have enormous space with the facility of both indoor and outdoor sitting .Now coming to the food , They had variety of items with interesting names in their menu . We went in a group so we ordered quite many dishes like Pawn salt & pepper
Mutton Galouti
Chicken tikka
Chicken pita pocket
Mushroom salt & pepper
Chilli corn
Fries bucket. And i must say, all the dishes were secculent in taste. The presentation of each and every dish was pleasing.Along with the food items we also ordered few vodka and beer based cocktails . All of them were great in taste but out of all Watermelon Beer became everyone's favourite .Overall it was a delightful experience and i would love to visit this place again.

Located in the heart of Sector 29 market, this place seemed like the best one to drink, dance and eat good food. Generally party places do not pay much heed to the food, but the times are changing and the Vapour Bar Exchange is already up there on the list serving great food with alcohol at really amazing prices courtesy their Bar Exchange.

The place is located on second floor right above Vapou Bar Grill. The place is spacious and appropriately lit up with lights. Furniture is old style and chick, suits the ambience if the place.

A must try is their freshly brewed Beer and cocktails.

My recommendation for food includes â€“ Crispy Chilli Corn, Mushroom Duplex, Palak Patta Chaat and Chicken 65 from the starters menu.

I also loved the Oriental Non Veg pizza.

Butter Chicken and Dal Makhani from the main-course menu lived to its expectation and made this place worth many visits for the fantastic food coupled with drinks and rocking great music.

Desserts werenâ€™t disappointing either â€“ Strawberry Cheese Cake was just wow.

I am definitely coming back.

his place is indeed one of the sought after place to party on a Friday/Saturday eve for eve. Rocking music, bar exchange where you will strike a good deal whenever the exchange crashes, freshly brewed beer and tasty food.

The best part about this place is their food. A brewery with awesome food is quite difficult to come across.

First order was Fresh Brewed Beer with some Watermelon flavor, to give it a twist. My own recepie and the bartender executed it fairly well.

Next up was food order

-	Vapour Fries â€“ My all time favourite assortment of Onions Rings, wedges, corn and cheese bites never disappoints.

-	Mushroom Duplex â€“ Fresh, tender and delicious Mushroom were lip smacking

-	Papri Chaat â€“ A great deviation from the traditional Chaat, this one is served with a slippery curd spheres atop the regular papri with Imly flavours. Fresh and taste

-	Pizza and Pasta are great too â€“ no specific favourite though

Skipped the main course and jumped directly to the desserts to taste the Strawberry Cheesecake which was great too

Must visit place with friends and family.
