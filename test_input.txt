Yesterday I been this place with my friend. Surprisingly I forgot that yesterday was semifinal of ICC champions trophy. First of all I love the ambiance.
 Its super cool and awesome. We have ordered virgin mojito and sweet and sour lemonade. With this we ask for white sauce pasta and veg plater.
 Pasta is so so delicious and yummy. Loved it, it must try dish over here. As we are enjoying match, we thought to order some more.
 Our next order is Vapour fries which is seriously so tasty. Specially I love the onion ring. But the only thing which I don't like
 is they ae late in their service. Rest all is super.
